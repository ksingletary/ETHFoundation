                    <h1>Lessons Learned</h1>
                    <p>
                        Throughout this course, I have been able to learn so much that has not only enhanced my 
                        academic performance but also shaped my personal and professional growth. Each topic we 
                        explored provided practical tools and strategies that I can carry forward in the future. 
                        Reflecting on my experiences, I see how this learning has strengthened my foundation 
                        and better prepared me for future challenges.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the most significant lessons I learned was the importance of self-awareness and 
                        goal-setting. Early in the course during Unit 1, I was introduced to the concept of 
                        self-regulated learning, which helped me identify my strengths and areas for improvement. 
                        I realized that while my motivation and metacognitive skills are strong, there is room to
                        grow in time management and strategy development. This awareness prompted me to set clear, 
                        actionable goals using the SMART framework in Unit 2. For example, I committed to sharpening 
                        my computer science skills over the next two years by enrolling in advanced courses and utilizing 
                        available resources. Establishing these goals has not only provided a sense of direction but also 
                        a roadmap for achieving long-term success.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Time management came up as another important theme throughout the course, especially in Unit 3. I 
                        learned to prioritize my most important tasks—my “big rocks”—and organize my schedule around them. 
                        This strategy has saved me countless times in balancing the demands of work, school, and personal commitments. 
                        By creating some sort of plan and using tools to stay organized, I have been able to manage my 
                        workload more effectively. This approach has also improved my focus and productivity, which I plan to 
                        maintain as I continue to navigate a busy and demanding schedule.
                    </p>

                        Building relationships and seeking support were also emphasized in my time during the course. Engaging with my 
                        success network, including peers, professors, and success coaches, underscored the value of collaboration and 
                        communication in Unit 4. I realized that asking for help and leveraging available resources is pretty important 
                        for overcoming any kind of challenge. For instance, conducting an informational interview with my mentor, Usman, 
                        showed me some much into the kinds of challenges and opportunities within my career field. These 
                        experiences have encouraged me to actively cultivate and expand my network, ensuring that 
                        I have a strong support system to guide me through future journeys. I learned a lot from the resources, 
                        and interview I conducted during Unit 6.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Staying informed about industry trends has also been a key takeaway. My research on advancements 
                        such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things (IoT), and progressive web applications 
                        highlighted the need to remain adaptable in a rapidly changing field. These trends I found 
                        during Unit 5 not only reflect the future of technology, but also present opportunities for professional 
                        growth. Moving forward, I plan to continue researching emerging technologies, attending webinars, 
                        and participating in relevant online communities to stay ahead in my ever-changing career.

                        During Unit 7, I explored the many support services available at UMGC, such as tutoring, writing assistance, 
                        and career counseling. Learning about these resources reminded me of the importance of seeking help when needed. 
                        I plan to proactively use these services to address challenges in my coursework and career planning. By 
                        utilizing these resources, I can improve my academic performance and better prepare for professional success in the future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, the course emphasized the importance of effective communication. Learning to articulate my needs, challenges, 
                        and goals clearly has been transformative in both academic and professional settings. Whether through written emails,
                        or in conversations with mentors and colleagues, clear communication ensures that I advocate for myself and 
                        build meaningful relationships. This skill will be critical as I tackle future projects and collaborate with others 
                        to achieve shared objectives.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This course has been an invaluable experience, equipping me with the tools and strategies needed to succeed academically and 
                        professionally. By setting clear goals, managing my time effectively, building a strong support network, staying informed 
                        about industry trends, and improving my communication skills, I feel confident in my ability to navigate future challenges. 
                        These lessons have not only strengthened my foundation but also inspired me to keep going, and also a sense of purpose and direction. 
                        As I continue my journey, I am excited to apply what I have learned and embrace the opportunities ahead.
